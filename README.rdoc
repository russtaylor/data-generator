= Teebo

Teebo is an application that generates data of any sort using the format
specified in the JSON that is passed in. The generator is meant to be fairly
efficient, though it's not guaranteed that generating huge datasets will be
completely snappy.

The highest priority is maintaining the flexibility in data generation and the
quality of overall data generation.
